  aboutMe: `I'm a developer with a problem-solving mindset. I have coded more than 1000 hours till now.
  I may not know everything, but I do know how to tackle problems — something I learned while building projects.
  Now I believe in thinking and planning more before coding because proper planning reduces execution time.`,
